# Nightstart
Basic setup for start using Nightwatch.js testing with Chrome and Selenium.
Based on the official documentation and the tutorial 'https://github.com/dwyl/learn-nightwatch'.

# Prerequisites
Have 'node.js' installed.

# How to use
Run 
```javascript
npm install
```
And after download dependencies. 
```javascript
node nightwatch.conf.js
```
*Running these two commands you won't need to download 'chromedriver' or 'selenium-server' since we have 'selenium-download' as dependency.*

To execute the tests, run the script:

```javascript
npm test
```
And see the magic happens!
